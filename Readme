Git Tips
-------

--When you want to establish a local remote tracked by a remote git ub repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/muthujothi/funwithprogramming.git

--Push the changes from local to remote
git push -u origin master



--Basic Git workflow, after you create initial Repos etc
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Create a new File or make Changes to an existing file
2. git add <F1> <F2>
This will stage the files for next step which is commit
3. git commit "message"
This will create a commit object out of the staged files and commit it in the local repository.
   git commit -a -m "message"
If there are lot of files to be staged and you want all of them to go to github, then simply use "-a" param which will
add everything there
